# Generative Benchmarking

![tech report card](img/card.png)

This project provides a comprehensive toolkit for generating custom benchmarks and replicating the results outlined in our [technical report](https://research.trychroma.com/generative-benchmarking).

## Motivation

Benchmarking is used to evaluate how well a model is performing, with the aim to generalize that performance to broader real-world scenarios. However, the widely-used benchmarks today often rely on artificially clean datasets and generic domains, with the added concern that they have likely already been seen by embedding models in training.

We introduce generative benchmarking as a way to address these limitations. Given a set of documents, we synthetically generate queries that are representative of the ground truth.


## Overview
This repository offers tools to:
- **Generate Custom Benchmarks:** Generate benchmarks tailored to your data and use case
- **Align LLMs:** Align your LLM judge to human preferences using an adapted version of [EvalGEN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12272)
- **Compare Results:** Compare metrics from your generated benchmark
- **Replicate Results:** Follow our guided notebooks to replicate the results presented in our technical report

## Repository Structure
